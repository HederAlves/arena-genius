## About the Game

Genius is a classic electronic memory game, first released in 1978. The game challenges players to remember increasingly longer sequences of colors and sounds.

## Operation

The game consists of an electronic device with four colored buttons - red, green, yellow, and blue. Which will be represented through software.

The game follows a random sequence of lights and sounds that players must replicate by pressing the buttons in the same order. With each round, the sequence increases in length, testing players' memory and attention.
